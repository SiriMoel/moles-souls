<Mod
name="Mole's Souls"
description="
This mod contains a new mechanic for Noita about gathering souls from enemies to use for your own endeavours and spells.
To obtain souls you need to kill enemies with a reaping spell, and you will obtain one of the [b]12[/b] soul types.
These can be used on your spells each granting different effects when used on spells like Soul Blast.
