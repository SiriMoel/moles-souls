SHOW LIVING AND GILDED SOULS SEPARATE IN UI

--- the quest --- 
called soul bounty ? (name doesnt rly matter tho)

UNCOVERING AN EXPERIMENT BY THE GRANDMASTER TO ACQUIRE IMMORTALITY
wandmaster drops more stones now (total 3?)
all turn liquids to con mana (BUT THEIR OWN SPECIAL CON MANA WHICH DOESNT MIX WITH NORMAL CON MANA)
if u mix all liquids together u get living reap and book
now use that to go get a living soul from a PW boss (as said in book but cryptically)
casting soul blast or soul slash with that soul gives the next clue
"make the hundred become one" when u have 100 living souls and cast soul lantern the next thing appears
^ world shakes and the location of the phylactery is revealed, time to go hunt and kill it
you hunt and kill it 
you win

ur getting alchemists notes throughout this n things ofc
