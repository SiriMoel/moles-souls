--- the quest --- 
called soul bounty

grandmaster's apprentice has found a way to use dread souls 
(name tbd, basically a different kind of soul with more "chaotic" effects)

u get a spell which lets u reap dread souls
if u bring a specific dread soul to a thing (most dread souls will probably be the 1 type tho idk)
u go to next part of quest ?

end boss can only be damaged by dread-soul powered spells (not sure how i can make that but thats ok)
